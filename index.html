        <p>The way this game is played is pretty simple:<br>
            You'll get four guesses (generous, I know) to guess my super secret number between 1 and 20.
            <p>FAQ:</p>
            <p>Are '1' and '20' valid guesses?</p><br>
            Ya, the number totally be 1 or 20 or anything in between.  It really depends upon my mood.
