        <p>The way this game is played is pretty simple.</p>
        <p>You'll get four chances (generous, I know)<br>
        to guess my super secret number between 1 and 20.</p>
        <p>Choose a square if you dare!<br>
        (Or enter a number below)</p>
        <!-- <p>FAQ:</p>
        <p>Are '1' and '20' valid guesses?</p><br> -->
        <!-- Ya, the number totally be 1 or 20 or anything in between.  It really depends upon my mood. -->

    use a table to give visual record of the guesses as well -->
